# Containerization with Docker and Kubernetes in Azure [Video]
This is the code repository for [Containerization with Docker and Kubernetes in Azure [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/virtualization-and-cloud/containerization-docker-and-kubernetes-azure-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). 
It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
From handling versioning efficiently, to enhancing security and portability, technologies such as Docker and Kubernetes have greatly benefitted application development 
and cloud deployments. Microsoft offers excellent containerization services with its Azure Container Services, and also supports both Docker and Kubernetes. 

The course focuses on application containerization using a combination of the dynamic duo, Docker and Kubernetes. It will show you how to get hands-on and take advantage 
of these two tools, alongside Azure Container Services, and improve the configuration and deployment of your applications on Azure Cloud. 

By the end of this course, you'll learn all about Docker and Kubernetes and will be able to configure, manage, and deploy applications on Azure Cloud.
